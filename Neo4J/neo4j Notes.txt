And here are examples of clauses that are used to update the graph:

    CREATE (and DELETE): Create (and delete) nodes and relationships.
    SET (and REMOVE): Set values to properties and add labels on nodes using SET and use REMOVE to remove them.
    MERGE: Match existing or create new nodes and patterns. This is especially useful together with unique constraints.
